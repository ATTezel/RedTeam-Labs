## 🛡️ Description

This lab introduced the core concepts of offensive security through a beginner-friendly simulation of a vulnerable banking website. The goal was to think like an attacker, identify weak points, and extract sensitive internal data using simple red team tactics.

---

## 🎯 Target System

- Simulated banking web app on a TryHackMe VM  
- Vulnerable to logic-based enumeration and information disclosure

---

## 🧨 Exploitation Steps

1. **Accessed the banking site** through TryHackMe’s hosted VM  
2. **Enumerated endpoints** manually and via browser inspection  
3. **Extracted employee roles and names** from poorly protected URL paths  
4. **Reported findings** as part of room completion process

---

## 📊 Real-World Relevance

In real-world environments, internal web apps often expose sensitive information through predictable URLs or insufficient access control. Identifying these flaws is part of both red team assessments and internal pentests.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Red teaming requires curiosity and a strategic mindset — not just tool usage  
- Vulnerabilities are not always technical — logic flaws can be just as dangerous  
- Ethical hacking simulations like TryHackMe help build confidence and structure  
- Learned to document findings and view systems from an adversarial perspective

## 📁 Notes

- This was my first hands-on exposure to thinking offensively.  
- It laid the foundation for more technical labs in this series.
