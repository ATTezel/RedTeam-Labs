##  Objective

Simulate an ethical hacking scenario by accessing a vulnerable website and extracting internal employee information using common red team techniques.

---

##  What I Did

- Understood the role of red teamers and penetration testers
- Learned the concept of ethical hacking in real-world simulation
- Interacted with a virtual machine simulating a banking website
- Extracted employee roles and names through vulnerable endpoints

##  Takeaways

- Red Teaming is not just about tools — it’s a mindset.
- Identifying exploitable logic can be as powerful as finding a vulnerability.
- I enjoy being in the attacker’s shoes and learning how systems fail.
