# 🛡️ RedTeam-Labs – Offensive Security Journey

> **By Arda Tezel – Software Engineering Student | Red Teaming & Offensive Security Enthusiast**  
> “Offense is the best form of learning.” Let’s break things — the right way.

This repository documents my hands-on journey into **Red Team operations**, **ethical hacking**, and **real-world offensive security** techniques.  
Across 13 weeks, I build and exploit vulnerable systems, simulate full attack chains, and report each lab as a real pentester would.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Gain practical, real-world offensive security skills.
- Build a reusable lab environment to practice red teaming.
- Learn reconnaissance, privilege escalation, post-exploitation, and social engineering techniques.
- Document each vulnerability like a professional report.
- Develop a GitHub portfolio that demonstrates both technical skill and structured thinking.

---

## 🧱 Lab Structure

Each lab includes:
- **🛡️ Description** – Real-world relevance of the vulnerability.
- **🎯 Target System** – Environment & service under test.
- **🧨 Exploitation Steps** – Tools, commands, payloads used.
- **📊 Impact** – What this vulnerability could mean in production.
- **🧠 What I Learned** – Personal reflection & technical growth.

## 📅 Week-by-Week Timeline

| Week | Focus Area | Key Outcome |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Recon & Nmap | Setup & discovery techniques |
| 2 | Web Vulns | SQLi, XSS, LFI |
| 3 | Docker | Containerized labs (e.g., Juice Shop) |
| 4 | Brute Forcing | FTP/SSH cracking, Dirb |
| 5 | Linux PrivEsc | GTFOBins, SUIDs |
| 6 | Windows PrivEsc | WinPEAS, PowerUp |
| 7 | CVEs & Exploits | Metasploit, distcc, vsftpd |
| 8 | Reverse Shells | Netcat, cron persistence |
| 9 | Social Engineering | Fake login site + phishing |
|10 | Network Bypass | Docker subnet attacks |
|11 | Red Team Chain | Full kill chain simulation |
|12 | Reporting | GitHub + LinkedIn portfolio polish |
|13 | Cloud Pentest | AWS S3 buckets & misconfigs |

## 🚀 Highlights – What I’ve Learned So Far

✅ Deployed and configured vulnerable systems (Metasploitable2, DVWA)  
✅ Performed in-depth reconnaissance using `nmap`, `enum4linux`, `dirb`  
✅ Exploited critical CVEs (e.g., `vsftpd 2.3.4`, `distcc_exec`)  
✅ Escalated privileges using SUID misconfigs and cron jobs  
✅ Created persistence via reverse shells and crontab injection  
✅ Documented attacks in a structured, report-style format  
✅ Gained insight into real-world exploitation chains  
✅ Built foundational skills for future Cloud & Active Directory pentests

## 👨‍💻 Why This Repo Matters

This project is my **offensive security playground**, but also my professional portfolio.  
It reflects how I:
- Approach problems methodically.
- Write clean, replicable labs.
- Combine technical skills with security thinking.

My goal is to turn curiosity into capability—and this repo is the roadmap.
