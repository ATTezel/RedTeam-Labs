# RedTeam-Labs 

> **By Arda Tezel – Software Engineering Student | Red Teaming & Offensive Security Enthusiast**

This repository documents my structured journey into **offensive security**, **red teaming**, and **ethical hacking**. Over the next 13 weeks, I will build practical labs, simulate real-world attack chains, and write detailed reports for each stage.

---

##  Objective

To become a highly skilled Red Team operator with hands-on knowledge in:
- Network & web-based reconnaissance
- Privilege escalation techniques (Linux & Windows)
- Exploitation and shell gaining
- Social engineering simulations
- Dockerized offensive labs
- Cloud pentesting (AWS – from week 13)

##  Timeline: Week-by-Week Plan

| Week | Focus | Key Output |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Setup & Nmap basics | RedTeam-Labs repo, TryHackMe start |
| 2 | OWASP + Web Vulns | SQL Injection lab |
| 3 | Docker fundamentals | Dockerized Juice Shop |
| 4 | Brute Force & Dirb | Docker Compose + FTP Crack |
| 5 | Linux PrivEsc | GTFOBins lab |
| 6 | Windows PrivEsc | PowerUp + WinPEAS lab |
| 7 | Metasploit & CVEs | Exploiting vulnerable services |
| 8 | Reverse Shells | Shell stabilizing & persistence |
| 9 | Social Engineering | Fake login simulation |
|10 | Network segmentation | Docker network bypass |
|11 | Red Team Chain | Full kill chain attack |
|12 | Reporting & CV update | GitHub + LinkedIn polish |
|13 | Cloud Security (Bonus) | AWS S3 Bucket lab |

# RedTeam-Labs
My journey into offensive security, red teaming, and ethical hacking labs.

---

##  What I Learned So Far

- Hands-on experience with Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 lab environments
- Conducted port scanning and service enumeration using Nmap
- Exploited real vulnerabilities (vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor)
- Gained root access and practiced basic post-exploitation techniques
- Documented attack steps like a professional red team report
- Built a solid base for advanced labs (privilege escalation, pivoting, etc.)
