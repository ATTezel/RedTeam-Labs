# üí• Lab03 ‚Äì Exploiting FTP Backdoor (vsftpd 2.3.4)

> **Date:** 23 May 2025  
> **Target:** Metasploitable2 ‚Äì FTP Service  
> **Vulnerability:** vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor  
> **CVE:** [CVE-2011-2523](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-2523)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Description

This lab focuses on exploiting a known backdoor vulnerability in **vsftpd 2.3.4**, a version of the Very Secure FTP Daemon that contains a malicious backdoor.  
By connecting to the FTP service with a specially crafted username, attackers can gain root shell access to the system.

---

## üéØ Target System

- Metasploitable2 VM  
- FTP running on port 21  
- Vulnerable service: vsftpd 2.3.4 (unauthenticated remote shell exploit)

---

## üß® Exploitation Steps

Used the **Metasploit Framework** to exploit the vulnerability:

```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101
set RPORT 21
run
```
### Outcome:

Successfully gained root shell access on the target machine

Verified elevated privileges and accessed restricted files

## üìä Real-World Relevance
Although this CVE is old, it simulates a typical real-world scenario:
Organizations often leave legacy systems exposed. Attackers actively scan for such misconfigurations and outdated services, making this kind of exploit highly realistic for entry vectors in penetration tests.

## üß† What I Learned
How to search, identify, and apply Metasploit CVE modules

Importance of version enumeration during reconnaissance

Real-world post-exploitation basics (privilege validation, shadow file access)

Proper usage of exploit parameters and validation commands

## Screenshot

The following screenshot captures the successful execution of the vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor exploit using Metasploit and resulting root shell access:

Verification of root access using basic system commands (`id`, `whoami`, `hostname`):

))

As part of post-exploitation, we accessed `/etc/shadow` to demonstrate privilege level:

## üìÅ Notes
- This lab taught me the full cycle: Recon ‚Üí Identify ‚Üí Exploit ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Document

- I now understand how Metasploit structures exploits and handles sessions

- This exploit is one of the first root-level shell gains in my Red Team Labs series
